		<p>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
			printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
			industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
			printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
			specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
			leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
			was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
			containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
			publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
			Ipsum.</p>
